# Video Capture Feature for Undiagnosed Illnesses

**Implementation Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** 100% Complete - Fully Integrated

---

## Overview

The video capture feature has been added to SymptIQ specifically to document dynamic symptoms associated with undiagnosed conditions like Morgellons disease, parasitic infections, and other mysterious illnesses that conventional medical frameworks may not adequately address.

---

## Why Video Documentation?

For conditions like Morgellons disease and other undiagnosed illnesses, static photos are insufficient because:

1. **Movement Documentation**: Subcutaneous movements, crawling sensations, and "bug-like" activity require video
2. **Fiber-like Structures**: Dynamic documentation of fiber emergence, movement, and characteristics
3. **Temporal Changes**: Observe how symptoms evolve in real-time
4. **Environmental Reactions**: Document how symptoms respond to temperature, moisture, light
5. **Proof for Medical Professionals**: Video provides undeniable evidence of unconventional symptoms

---

### 2. Video Analysis AI Service ✅
**Location:** `lib/services/videoAnalysisService.ts`

**Key Functions:**

#### `analyzeUndiagnosedVideo()`
Specifically designed to look BEYOND conventional medical patterns.

**Analyzes for:**
- **Unconventional Findings**: Fiber-like structures, crystalline formations, unusual extrusions
- **Movement Analysis**: Subcutaneous activity, surface movement, pulsating/wriggling motions
- **Texture Anomalies**: Lesion patterns, skin texture changes, color variations
- **Fiber-like Structures**: Black, blue, red, white fibers with location and characteristics
- **Subcutaneous Movement**: Under-skin activity patterns and frequency
- **Color Changes**: Temporal color variations during video
- **Temporal Analysis**: How symptoms evolve during recording
- **Environmental Factors**: Lighting, moisture, temperature indicators

**Critical AI Instruction:**
```
"DO NOT dismiss findings as 'artifacts' or 'debris' - document everything you observe.
DO NOT apply standard dermatology constraints - consider ALL possibilities.
DO NOT assume conventional causes - this is an UNDIAGNOSED condition."
```

**Returns:**
- Timestamped observations (e.g., "At 12 seconds, visible fiber-like structure")
- Specific recommendations for focus areas
- Follow-up questions tailored to observations
- Confidence scoring

#### `compareVideos()`

## AI Analysis Approach for Morgellons/Undiagnosed Conditions

### Key Differentiators

1. **No Dismissal Policy**: AI will NOT dismiss findings as "lint," "debris," or "artifacts"
2. **Open-Minded Analysis**: AI considers unconventional explanations
3. **Detailed Documentation**: Everything observed is documented with timestamps
4. **Pattern Recognition**: AI looks for patterns unique to reported conditions
5. **Comparative Analysis**: AI compares findings to known Morgellons characteristics

### Morgellons-Specific Detection

**Fiber Characteristics AI Looks For:**
- Color (black, blue, red, white, multicolored)
- Movement patterns (static, floating, emerging, retracting)
- Texture (smooth, rough, crystalline, organic)
- Size (microscopic to macroscopic)
- Location (surface vs embedded)
- Behavior (response to light, heat, touch)

**Movement Patterns AI Detects:**
- Crawling sensations visualization
- Subcutaneous activity
- Pulsating movements
- Directional migration
- Speed and frequency of movement

**Lesion Analysis:**
- Geometric patterns (common in Morgellons)
- Cluster formations
- Central plugs or cores
- Fiber emergence points
- Healing vs spreading patterns

### Medical Disclaimer

**Important:** This AI analysis is for DOCUMENTATION purposes only. It:
- Does NOT provide medical diagnosis
- Does NOT replace professional medical evaluation
- DOES help organize observations for medical consultations
- DOES provide structured data for research
- DOES validate patient experiences through objective documentation

## User Instructions

### Best Practices for Video Documentation

**Before Recording:**
1. Clean the area gently (don't disturb symptoms)
2. Ensure good lighting (natural light is best)
3. Have a steady surface or tripod if possible
4. Prepare to narrate what you're observing

**During Recording:**
5. Start with wide shot showing context
6. Zoom in slowly to areas of concern
7. Hold steady on points of interest (5-10 seconds)
8. Narrate what you're experiencing (sensations, timing, etc.)
9. Show scale (place finger, ruler, or coin nearby)
10. Capture any movement for at least 10 seconds

**After Recording:**
11. Review video before submitting
12. Note key timestamps in symptom description
13. Answer AI follow-up questions thoroughly
14. Compare with previous videos if available

### What to Document with Video

**Ideal Use Cases:**
- Movement under the skin
- Fiber-like structures emerging or moving
- Crawling sensations with visible activity
- Changes over short time periods (hours/days)
- Response to treatments (before/after)
- Environmental reactions (heat, cold, water)
- Unusual skin behavior (self-healing, rapid changes)

**Not Ideal for Video:**
- Static lesions (use photos)
- Very slow changes (use timelapse)
- Wide-area documentation (use multiple photos)
- Long-term tracking (use photo series)
