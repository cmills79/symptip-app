# MCP Server Cheat Sheet

## One-Line Summaries

| MCP Server | Use When | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **filesystem** | Reading/writing project files | "Edit PhotoCapture.tsx" |
| **git** | Version control operations | "Commit these changes" |
| **playwright** | Testing user workflows | "Test photo upload flow" |
| **memory** | Storing project knowledge | "Remember this architecture decision" |
| **fetch** | Getting external docs/info | "Look up Next.js 14 docs" |
| **sequential-thinking** | Complex problem solving | "Debug video processing issue" |

## The 3 Most Important Rules

### 1. User-Facing Feature? â†’ PLAYWRIGHT
Every UI change, feature, or user workflow MUST be tested with Playwright.

### 2. Saving Work? â†’ GIT
Before switching tasks or completing features, always commit with Git.

### 3. Complex Issue? â†’ SEQUENTIAL-THINKING
Multi-step problems, architecture decisions, or deep debugging require sequential-thinking.

## Quick Decision Table

| I need to... | Use This MCP |
|--------------|--------------|
| Read a file | filesystem |
| Write a file | filesystem |
| Test a feature | playwright |
| Commit code | git |
| Create PR | git |
| Check history | git |
| Look up docs | fetch |
| Research library | fetch |
| Debug complex bug | sequential-thinking |
| Plan architecture | sequential-thinking |
| Store decision | memory |
| Recall pattern | memory |

## Test Requirement Triggers

Use **Playwright** immediately when touching:
- âœ… Photo capture components
- âœ… Camera/video features
- âœ… Authentication flows
- âœ… Photo gallery
- âœ… Timelapse generation
- âœ… File uploads
- âœ… Any user-facing UI

## Commit Triggers

Use **Git** immediately when:
- âœ… Feature is complete
- âœ… Bug is fixed
- âœ… Before switching tasks
- âœ… Refactoring is done
- âœ… Tests are passing

## Research Triggers

Use **Fetch** when you need:
- âœ… Latest documentation
- âœ… API reference
- âœ… Library information
- âœ… Best practices
- âœ… Breaking changes info

## Deep Thinking Triggers

Use **Sequential-thinking** for:
- âœ… New feature architecture
- âœ… Performance optimization
- âœ… Security analysis
- âœ… Complex debugging
- âœ… Multi-step planning

## SymptIQ Workflow Templates

### Adding New UI Component
```
filesystem â†’ Edit/create component
playwright â†’ Test component
git â†’ Commit
```

### Fixing Bug
```
git â†’ Check when introduced
sequential-thinking â†’ Analyze (if complex)
filesystem â†’ Fix code
playwright â†’ Verify fix
git â†’ Commit
```

### New Feature
```
sequential-thinking â†’ Plan
fetch â†’ Research (if needed)
filesystem â†’ Implement
playwright â†’ Test
memory â†’ Store decisions
git â†’ Commit + PR
```

### Security Update
```
sequential-thinking â†’ Analyze
fetch â†’ Check best practices
filesystem â†’ Update rules/code
playwright â†’ Test security
git â†’ Commit
```

## Never Forget

ðŸŽ¯ **Every feature needs Playwright tests**
ðŸŽ¯ **Every change needs Git commits**
ðŸŽ¯ **Complex problems need Sequential-thinking**
