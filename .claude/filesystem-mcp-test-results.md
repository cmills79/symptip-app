### 6. Scope Verification ✅

#### Root Directory Access
**Path:** `C:\Users\Clay\source\repos\symptiq\`
**Files Found:** 22 files including:
- Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Firebase config (firebase.json, firestore.rules)
- Documentation (README.md, PRD.md, PROGRESS.md)
- Build configs (next.config.ts, playwright.config.ts)

#### Subdirectory Access (.claude/)
**Path:** `C:\Users\Clay\source\repos\symptiq\.claude\`
**Files Found:** 11 files including:
- Agent definitions (5 specialist agents)
- MCP documentation (4 docs)
- Settings (settings.local.json)
- Test file (filesystem-mcp-test.txt)

#### Source Directory Access
**Directories Verified:**
- `app/` - 3 files (layout, page, globals.css)
- `components/` - 1 file at root + subdirectories
- `lib/` - 1 file (firebase.ts) + subdirectories

---

## Capabilities Confirmed

### ✅ Can Perform
- [x] Read any file in project directory
- [x] Write new files to project directory
- [x] Edit/modify existing files
- [x] Search files by glob patterns
- [x] Search file contents with regex (Grep)
- [x] Access nested subdirectories
- [x] List directory contents
- [x] Create files in subdirectories

### ❌ Cannot Perform (By Design)
- [ ] Access files outside project directory
- [ ] Access parent directories
- [ ] Execute system commands
- [ ] Network operations

---

## Security Validation

### Scope Limitations ✅
- **Restricted to:** `C:\Users\Clay\source\repos\symptiq\`
- **Cannot access:** Parent directories, system files, other projects
- **Safety:** Properly sandboxed to project directory

### Permission Warnings
⚠️ **Can read sensitive files within project:**
- `.env` files (if present)
- API keys in configuration
- Firebase credentials

**Recommendation:** Always use `.gitignore` for sensitive files
